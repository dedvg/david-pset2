This app makes a story for the user.
First the user will be asked to select a story.
When the story is selected the user can putt in words to fill the story.
When the last word needs to be filled in a button "go to story" will appear.
If the button is clicked and at least one character is filled in the user sees his story with the filled in words.
If the text is too large it enables the user to scroll.
